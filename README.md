This code is for RoboCup Rescue, Agent Simulation League and it's written for AmirKabir Robotic center, Amirkabir University of Technology. Many version of this code is released during the years in sourceforge but here is the latest and the most reliable version.

## Agent Simulation competition
The Agent Simulation competition involves primarily evaluating the performance of agent teams on different maps of the RoboCup Rescue Agent Simulation (RCRS) platform, a comprehensive simulation environment for research in disaster response management.. Specifically, this competition involves evaluating the effectiveness of Ambulances, Police Forces, and Fire Brigades agents on rescuing civilians and extinguishing fires in cities where an earthquake has just happened. This competition is composed of a preliminary round, a semi-final round, and a final round. Each round is composed of a set of maps representing different possible situations used for evaluating and scoring each agent team at each round. A consolidated score is assigned to each team per round.
